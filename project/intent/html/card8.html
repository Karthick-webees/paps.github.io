                    Development of the fourth John Wick film, formally announced by Lionsgate in May 2019, was confirmed prior to the release of its predecessor. It is the first film in the franchise that was not written by franchise creator Derek Kolstad, with Hatten hired in May 2020, followed by Finch in March 2021. Principal photography took place from June to October 2021, and filming locations included France, Germany, New York City, and Japan.

                    The original release date of May 21, 2021, was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[5] John Wick: Chapter 4 premiered at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on March 6, 2023, and was released in the United States on March 24. The film received widespread acclaim from critics and has grossed over $432 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film in the franchise and the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2023.
